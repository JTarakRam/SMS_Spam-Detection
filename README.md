# SMS_Spam-Detection<br>
## spam Detection<br>
**Spam detection** is a critical process that involves recognising and filtering out undesired or unsolicited communications, generally referred to as spam, from valid messages sent by email, text messaging, and social media postings.<br>

The importance of spam detection stems from its capacity to safeguard users against potentially damaging and fraudulent messages such as phishing attempts and other sorts of frauds. Spam mail can also cause congested and unmanageable inboxes, leading users to be inconvenienced.

+ The research under consideration focuses on recognising spam or ham (legal messages) using SMS data. <br>
+ This project necessitates the analysis of SMS messages in order to uncover patterns and features that distinguish spam messages from authentic ones. <br>
+ Based on these similarities, the project's ultimate objective is to create a machine learning model that can reliably categorise incoming SMS messages as spam or ham.<br>

This sort of project is critical since SMS texting is a common mode of communication, and spam messages may be a major issue. Creating an accurate spam detection model can assist consumers in avoiding potentially hazardous or undesired communications and improving their overall messaging experience.<br>
